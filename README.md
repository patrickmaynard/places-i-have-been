# places-i-have-been
A script to download a bunch of screensaver images. The images are either public-domain pictures or fall under open-source licenses, and they generally portray places to which I have some strong emotional link. 

TODO items:

-- Add the main download script

-- Add a comment over each image in the script telling where to find license info for that image

-- Add an "image" of bitmap text directing people to this repository for license information
